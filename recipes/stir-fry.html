    <li>Wash and dry all produce. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Trim and thinly slice scallions. Mince or
      grate garlic. Peel and mince ginger. Whisk together sesame oil, 1 TBSP ketchup, soy sauce, 1½ TBSP hoisin sauce,
      and 1 TBSP water in a small bowl.</li>
    <li>Add broccoli to boiling water and cook until tender but still crisp, 3-4
      minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Toss steak tips with cornstarch in a large bowl. Season generously with salt and pepper. Heat a large drizzle of
      oil in a large pan over high heat. (TIP: If you have a nonstick pan, break it out.) Toss in steak tips and cook to
      desired doneness, 3-4 minutes. Remove and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium heat. Add garlic, ginger, and scallions and cook until fragrant, 1
      minute, tossing. Toss in half the noodles from the package (we sent more) and a drizzle of oil. Break up noodles
      until they no longer stick together, using tongs or two wooden spoons.</li>
    <li>Pour in 1 cup water, cover, and steam until noodles are tender, 3 minutes. (TIP: If your pan doesn’t have a lid,
      carefully cover it with aluminum foil.) Uncover, increase heat to medium-high, and toss until noodles are tender,
      3-4 minutes. Add sauce and toss to coat. Cook until sauce is thickened, 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Toss broccoli and steak into noodles to warm through. Season with as much sriracha as you like (careful, it’s
      spicy). Season with salt and pepper. Divide between plates and serve.</li>
